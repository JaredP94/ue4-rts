## Cheats

The plugin comes with a small set of built-in cheats you can use. Feel free to create your own cheat manager and add additional cheats.


1. Create a cheat manager deriving from `RTSCheatManager`.
1. Set the _Resource Types_ of your cheat manager.
1. At your `RTSPlayerController`, set the _Cheat Manager_ to your cheat manager.
1. At _Edit > Project Settings > Engine > Input_, set and remember your _Console Keys_.

This will unlock the following built-in cheats to use in your console:

| Cheat | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Boost | Increases construction and production speed. |
| Damage | Increase damage of all own units. |
| God | Invulnerability cheat. |
| NoFog | Toggles fog of war on/off. |
| Money | Adds resources. |
| Victory | Defeat all other players. |
| Weak | Decreases damage of all own units. |
