## Game Modes

Clearly, even for real-time strategy games, you may want to define multiple game modes (such as classic Skirmish or story-based campaigns). Thus, we won't restrict you too much here, but just want to provide a few basic things that you might find useful.


### Initialization

1. Set the _Initial Actors_ and their locations for your game mode. This will spawn initial units for each player at their player start as soon as the game starts.


### Teams

1. Set _Num Teams_ to the number of teams your game mode supports.


### Game Over

1. Optionally, set the _Defeat Condition Actor Classes_ for your `RTSGameMode`. This will check whether any actors of the specified types exist for a player whenever he or she loses a unit. If no actor of the specified type remains, the player is defeated.

_In that case, the game mode will raise the OnPlayerDefeated event to be overridden in subclasses (either blueprint or C++). Note that it is up to you to define how defeated players should be handled, and if/when the game is over, e.g. whether you've making a 1v1, FFA or team game._
